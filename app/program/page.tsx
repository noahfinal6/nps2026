              Building on the strong national foundation established in 2024 and the continental expansion achieved in 2025, the 2026 National Pre-Retirement Summit represents a strategic shift from awareness to execution. With the theme "Own Your Retirement: From Planning to Action," the Summit will focus on enabling participants to translate knowledge into concrete decisions, enterprises, investments, and lifestyle changes that support long-term security, purpose, and wellbeing.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
              The Summit will bring together policymakers, labour unions, pension administrators, financial service providers, health and wellness experts, entrepreneurs, and prospective retirees to create a comprehensive ecosystem that supports the transition from active service into financially secure, healthy, and purpose-driven post-service lives.
