                The National Pre-Retirement Summit (NPS) is Nigeria&apos;s premier and fast-emerging Pan-African platform dedicated to transforming retirement from a period of uncertainty into one of financial stability, continued productivity, and purposeful living.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Across Nigeria and much of Africa, retirement is increasingly defined by rising living costs, healthcare pressures, inadequate financial preparation, and limited post-service transition support. Many retirees enter this phase without the investment knowledge, entrepreneurial skills, or structured guidance required to sustain their livelihoods and quality of life.

                Designed as a one-stop retirement readiness hub, the Summit convenes policymakers, labour unions, pension managers, financial institutions, development partners, healthcare providers, technology firms, and solution providers to equip professionals—particularly those with 0–10 years to retirement—with the tools, skills, and opportunities needed for a secure, productive, and dignified post-service life.

                The NPS exists because retirement should be a celebration of a life&apos;s work—not a source of anxiety. By bringing together all stakeholders in the retirement ecosystem, we create a unified platform for knowledge transfer, policy advocacy, and practical solutions that empower individuals to take ownership of their retirement journey.
